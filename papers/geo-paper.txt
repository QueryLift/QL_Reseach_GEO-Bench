ABSTRACT

CCS CONCEPTS

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has ushered in a new
paradigm of search engines that use generative models to gather
and summarize information to answer user queries. This emerging
technology, which we formalize under the unified framework of
generative engines (GEs), can generate accurate and personalized
responses, rapidly replacing traditional search engines like Google
and Bing. Generative Engines typically satisfy queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources and summarizing them
using LLMs. While this shift significantly improves user utility
and generative search engine traffic, it poses a huge challenge for
the third stakeholder – website and content creators. Given the
black-box and fast-moving nature of generative engines, content
creators have little to no control over when and how their content
is displayed. With generative engines here to stay, we must ensure
the creator economy is not disadvantaged. To address this, we introduce Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the first novel
paradigm to aid content creators in improving their content visibility in generative engine responses through a flexible black-box
optimization framework for optimizing and defining visibility metrics. We facilitate systematic evaluation by introducing GEO-bench,
a large-scale benchmark of diverse user queries across multiple domains, along with relevant web sources to answer these queries.
Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that GEO can boost
visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses. Moreover,
we show the efficacy of these strategies varies across domains, underscoring the need for domain-specific optimization methods. Our
work opens a new frontier in information discovery systems, with
profound implications for both developers of generative engines
and content creators.1

INTRODUCTION

The invention of traditional search engines three decades ago revolutionized information access and dissemination globally [4]. While
they were powerful and ushered in a host of applications like academic research and e-commerce, they were limited to providing
a list of relevant websites for user queries. However, the recent
success of large language models [5, 21] has paved the way for
better systems like BingChat, Google’s SGE, and perplexity.ai that
combine conventional search engines with generative models. We
dub these systems generative engines (GE) because they search for
information and generate multi-modal responses by using multiple
sources. Technically, generative engines (Figure 2) retrieve relevant
documents from a database (like the internet) and use large neural
models to generate a response grounded on the sources, ensuring
attribution and a way for the user to verify the information.
The usefulness of generative engines for developers and users
is evident – users access information faster and more accurately,
while developers craft precise and personalized responses, improving user satisfaction and revenue. However, generative engines
disadvantage the third stakeholder – website and content creators.
Generative Engines, in contrast to traditional search engines, remove the need to navigate to websites by directly providing a
precise and comprehensive response, potentially reducing organic
traffic to websites and impacting their visibility [16]. With millions
of small businesses and individuals relying on online traffic and
visibility for their livelihood, generative engines will significantly
disrupt the creator economy. Further, the black-box and proprietary nature of generative engines makes it difficult for content

Figure 1: Our proposed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) method optimizes websites to boost their visibility in
Generative Engine responses. GEO’s black-box optimization framework then enables the website owner of the pizza website,
which lacked visibility originally, to optimize their website to increase visibility under Generative Engines. Further, GEO’s
general framework allows content creators to define and optimize their custom visibility metrics, giving them greater control
in this new emerging paradigm.
creators to control and understand how their content is ingested
and portrayed.
In this work, we propose the first general creator-centric framework to optimize content for generative engines, which we dub
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), to empower content
creators to navigate this new search paradigm. GEO is a flexible
black-box optimization framework for optimizing web content visibility for proprietary and closed-source generative engines (Figure 1). GEO ingests a source website and outputs an optimized
version by tailoring and calibrating the presentation, text style, and
content to increase visibility in generative engines.
Further, GEO introduces a flexible framework for defining visibility metrics tailor-made for generative engines as the notion of
visibility in generative engines is more nuanced and multi-faceted
than traditional search engines (Figure 3). While average ranking
on the response page is a good measure of visibility in traditional
search engines, which present a linear list of websites, this does
not apply to generative engines. Generative Engines provide rich,
structured responses and embed websites as inline citations in the
response, often embedding them with different lengths, at varying
positions, and with diverse styles. This necessitates the need for visibility metrics tailor-made for generative engines, which measure
the visibility of attributed sources over multiple dimensions, such
as relevance and influence of citation to query, measured through
both an objective and a subjective lens.
To facilitate faithful and extensive evaluation of GEO methods,
we propose GEO-bench, a benchmark consisting of 10000 queries
from diverse domains and sources, adapted for generative engines.

Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that our proposed
Generative Engine Optimization methods can boost visibility by
up to 40% on diverse queries, providing beneficial strategies for content creators. Among other things, we find that including citations,
quotations from relevant sources, and statistics can significantly
boost source visibility, with an increase of over 40% across various
queries. We also demonstrate the efficacy of Generative Engine
Optimization on Perplexity.ai, a real-world generative engine and
demonstrate visibility improvements up to 37%.
In summary, our contributions are three-fold:
(1) We propose Generative Engine Optimization, the first general optimization framework for website owners to optimize their
websites for generative engines. Generative Engine Optimization can improve the visibility of websites by up to 40% on a wide
range of queries, domains, and real-world black-box generative
engines.
(2) Our framework proposes a comprehensive set of visibility metrics specifically designed for generative engines and enables content
creators to flexibly optimize their content through customized visibility metrics.
(3) To foster faithful evaluation of GEO methods in generative engines, we propose the first large-scale benchmark consisting of
diverse search queries from wide-ranging domains and datasets
specially tailored for Generative Engines.

Figure 3 for a representative generative engine response.

2.2

The advent of search engines led to search engine optimization
(SEO), a process to help website creators optimize their content to
improve search engine rankings. Higher rankings correlate with
increased visibility and website traffic. However, traditional SEO
methods are not directly applicable to Generative Engines. This is
because, unlike traditional search engines, the generative model
in generative engines is not limited to keyword matching, and
the use of language models in ingesting source documents and
response generation results in a more nuanced understanding of
text documents and user query. With generative engines rapidly
emerging as the primary information delivery paradigm and SEO
is not directly applicable; new techniques are needed. To this end,
we propose Generative Engine Optimization, a new paradigm
where content creators aim to increase their visibility (or impression) in generative engine responses. We define the visibility of a
website (also referred to as a citation) 𝑐𝑖 in a cited response 𝑟 by the
function 𝐼𝑚𝑝 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑟 ), which the website creator wants to maximize.
From the generative engine’s perspective, the goal is to maximize
the visibility of citations most relevant to the user query, i.e., maxiÍ
mize 𝑖 𝑓 (𝐼𝑚𝑝 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑟 ), 𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑞, 𝑟 )), where 𝑅𝑒𝑙 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑞, 𝑟 ) measures the
relevance of citation 𝑐𝑖 to the query 𝑞 in the context of response 𝑟
and 𝑓 is determined by the exact algorithmic design of generative
engine and is a black-box function to end-users. Further, both the
functions 𝐼𝑚𝑝 and 𝑅𝑒𝑙 are subjective and not well-defined yet for
generative engines, and we define them next.

Figure 2: Overview of Generative Engines. Generative Engines primrarily consists of a set of generative models and a
search engine to retrieve relevant documents. Generative Engines take user query as input and through a series of steps
generate a final response that is grounded in the retrieved
sources with inline attributions.

2 FORMULATION & METHODOLOGY
2.1 Formulation of Generative Engines
Despite the deployment of numerous generative engines to millions
of users, there is currently no standard framework. We provide a formulation that accommodates various modular components in their
design. We describe a generative engine, which includes several
backend generative models and a search engine for source retrieval.
A Generative Engine (GE) takes a user query 𝑞𝑢 and returns a natural language response 𝑟 , where 𝑃𝑈 represents personalized user
information. The GE can be represented as a function:
𝑓𝐺𝐸 := (𝑞𝑢 , 𝑃𝑈 ) → 𝑟

2.2.1 Impressions for Generative Engines. In SEO, a website’s impression (or visibility) is determined by its average ranking over
a range of queries. However, generative engines’ output nature
necessitates different impression metrics. Unlike search engines,
Generative Engines combine information from multiple sources
in a single response. Factors such as length, uniqueness, and presentation of the cited website determine the true visibility of a
citation. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 3, while a simple ranking
on the response page serves as an effective metric for impression
and visibility in conventional search engines, such metrics are not
applicable to generative engine responses.
In response to this challenge, we propose a suite of impression
metrics designed with three key principles in mind: 1.) The metrics
should hold relevance for creators, 2.) They should be explainable,
and 3.) They should be easily comprehensible by a broad spectrum
of content creators. The first of these metrics, the “Word Count”
metric, is the normalized word count of sentences related to a
citation. Mathematically, this is defined as:
Í
𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑐 |𝑠 |
𝐼𝑚𝑝 𝑤𝑐 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑟 ) = Í 𝑖
(2)
𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑟 |𝑠 |

Generative Engines comprise two crucial components: a.) A set
of generative models 𝐺 = {𝐺 1, 𝐺 2 ...𝐺𝑛 }, each serving a specific purpose like query reformulation or summarization, and b.) A search
engine 𝑆𝐸 that returns a set of sources 𝑆 = {𝑠 1, 𝑠 2 ...𝑠𝑚 } given a
query 𝑞. We present a representative workflow in Figure 2, which,
at the time of writing, closely resembles the design of BingChat. This
workflow breaks down the input query into a set of simpler queries
that are easier to consume for the search engine. Given a query, a
query re-formulating generative model, 𝐺 1 = 𝐺𝑞𝑟 , generates a set
of queries 𝑄 1 = {𝑞 1, 𝑞 2 ...𝑞𝑛 }, which are then passed to the search
engine 𝑆𝐸 to retrieve a set of ranked sources 𝑆 = {𝑠 1, 𝑠 2, ..., 𝑠𝑚 }. The
sets of sources 𝑆 are passed to a summarizing model 𝐺 2 = 𝐺𝑠𝑢𝑚 ,
which generates a summary 𝑆𝑢𝑚 𝑗 for each source in 𝑆, resulting in
the summary set (𝑆𝑢𝑚 = {𝑆𝑢𝑚 1, 𝑆𝑢𝑚 2, ..., 𝑆𝑢𝑚𝑚 }). The summary
set is passed to a response-generating model 𝐺 3 = 𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 , which
generates a cumulative response 𝑟 backed by sources 𝑆. In this work,
we focus on single-turn Generative Engines, but the formulation
can be extended to multi-turn Conversational Generative Engines
(Appendix A).
The response 𝑟 is typically a structured text with embedded
citations. Citations are important given the tendency of LLMs to
hallucinate information [10]. Specifically, consider a response 𝑟
composed of sentences {𝑙 1, 𝑙 2 ...𝑙𝑜 }. Each sentence may be backed
by a set of citations that are part of the retrieved set of documents
𝐶𝑖 ⊂ 𝑆. An ideal generative engine should ensure all statements
in the response are supported by relevant citations (high citation
recall), and all citations accurately support the statements they’re

Here 𝑆𝑐𝑖 is the set of sentences citing 𝑐𝑖 , 𝑆𝑟 is the set of sentences
in the response, and |𝑠 | is the number of words in sentence 𝑠. In
cases where a sentence is cited by multiple sources, we share the
word count equally with all the citations. Intuitively, a higher word
count correlates with the source playing a more important part in
the answer, and thus, the user gets higher exposure to that source.

Figure 3: Ranking and Visibility Metrics are straightforward in traditional search engines, which list website sources in ranked
order with verbatim content. However, Generative Engines generate rich, structured responses, often embedding citations
in a single block interleaved with each other. This makes ranking and visibility nuanced and multi-faceted. Further, unlike
search engines, where significant research has been conducted on improving visibility, optimizing visibility in generative
engine responses remains unclear. To address these challenges, our black-box optimization framework proposes a series of
well-designed impression metrics that creators can use to gauge and optimize their website’s performance and also allows the
creator to define their impression metrics.
However, since “Word Count” is not impacted by the ranking of
the citations (whether it appears first, for example), we propose a
position-adjusted count that reduces the weight by an exponentially
decaying function of the citation position:
Í
𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑐 (𝑐𝑖 , 𝑟 ) =

𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑐𝑖 |𝑠 | · 𝑒

Í

−

𝑠 ∈𝑆𝑟 |𝑠 |

the modified content after applying the GEO method. The modifications can range from simple stylistic alterations to incorporating
new content in a structured format. A well-designed GEO is equivalent to a black-box optimization method that, without knowing
the exact algorithmic design of generative engines, can increase
the website’s visibility and implement textual modifications to 𝑊
independent of the exact queries.
For our experiments, we apply Generative Engine Optimization methods on website content using a large language model,
prompted to perform specific stylistic and content changes to the
website. In particular, based on the GEO method defining a specific set of desired characteristics, the source content is modified
accordingly. We propose and evaluate several such methods:
1: Authoritative: Modifies text style of the source content to be
more persuasive and authoritative, 2. Statistics Addition: Modifies
content to include quantitative statistics instead of qualitative discussion, wherever possible, 3. Keyword Stuffing: Modifies content
to include more keywords from the query, as expected in classical SEO optimization. 4. Cite Sources & 5. Quotation Addition:
Adds relevant citations and quotations from credible sources respectively, 6.) 6. Easy-to-Understand: Simplifies the language of
website, while 7. Fluency Optimization improves the fluency of
website text. 8. Unique Words & 9. Technical Terms: involves
adding unique and technical terms respectively wherever possible,
These methods cover diverse general strategies that website
owners can implement quickly and use regardless of the website
content. Further, except for methods 3, 4, and 5, the remaining
methods enhance the presentation of existing content to increase
its persuasiveness or appeal to the generative engine, without requiring extra content. On the other hand, methods 3,4 and 5 may

Intuitively, sentences that appear first in the response are more
likely to be read, and the exponent term in definition 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑝𝑤𝑐 gives
higher weightage to such citations. Thus, a website cited at the
top may have a higher impression despite having a lower word
count than a website cited in the middle or end of the response.
Further, the choice of exponentially decaying function is motivated
by several studies showing click-through rates follow a power-law
as a function of ranking in search engines [7, 8]. While the above
impression metrics are objective and well-grounded, they ignore
the subjective aspects of the impact of citations on the user’s attention. To address this, we propose the "Subjective Impression"
metric, which incorporates facets such as the relevance of the cited
material to the user query, influence of the citation, uniqueness of
the material presented by a citation, subjective position, subjective
count, probability of clicking the citation, and diversity in the material presented. We use G-Eval [15], the current state-of-the-art
for evaluation with LLMs, to measure each of these sub-metrics.
2.2.2 Generative Engine Optimization methods for website. To
improve impression metrics, content creators must make changes
to their website content. We present several generative engineagnostic strategies, referred to as Generative Engine Optimization methods (GEO). Mathematically, every GEO method is a function 𝑓 : 𝑊 → 𝑊𝑖′ , where 𝑊 is the initial web content, and 𝑊 ′ is

an updated list of trending queries on the platform. 8. ELI-53 : This
dataset contains questions from the ELI5 subreddit, where users ask
complex questions and expect answers in simple, layman’s terms.
9. GPT-4 Generated Queries: To supplement diversity in query
distribution, we prompt GPT-4 [21] to generate queries ranging
from various domains (e.g., science, history) and based on query
intent (e.g., navigational, transactional) and based on difficulty and
scope of generated response (e.g., open-ended, fact-based).

require some form of additional content. To analyze the performance gain of our methods, for each input user query, we randomly
select one source website to be optimized and apply each of the
GEO methods separately on the same source. We refer readers to
Appendix B.4 for more details on GEO methods.

3 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
3.1 Evaluated Generative Engine

. Our benchmark comprises 10K queries divided into 8K, 1K, and
1K for train, validation, and test splits, respectively. We preserve
the real-world query distribution, with our benchmark containing
80% informational queries and 10% each for transactional and navigational queries. Each query is augmented with the cleaned text
content of the top 5 search results from the Google search engine.

In accordance with previous works [14], we use a 2-step setup for
Generative Engine design. The first step involves fetching relevant
sources for input query, followed by a second step where an LLM
generates a response based on the fetched sources. Similar to prevous works, we do not use summarization and provide the whole
response for each source. Due to context length limitations and quadratic scaling cost based on the context size of transformer models,
only the top 5 sources are fetched from the Google search engine
for every query. The setup closely mimics the workflow used in
previous works and the general design adopted by commercial GEs
such as you.com and perplexity.ai. The answer is then generated
by the gpt3.5-turbo model [20] using the same prompt as prior
work [14]. We sample 5 different responses at temperature=0.7, to
reduce statistical deviations.
Further in Section C.1, we evaluate the same Generative Engine
Optimization methods on Perplexity.ai, which is a commercially
deployed generative engine, highlighting the generalizability of our
proposed Generative Engine Optimization methods.

3.2

Tags. Optimizing website content often requires targeted changes
based on the task’s domain. Additionally, a user of Generative
Engine Optimization may need to identify an appropriate method
for only a subset of queries, considering multiple factors such as
domain, user intent, and query nature. To facilitate this, we tag each
query with one of seven different categories. For tagging, we employ the GPT-4 model and manually verify high recall and precision
on the test split.
Overall, GEO-bench consists of queries from 25 diverse domains
such as Arts, Health, and Games; it features a range of query difficulties from simple to multi-faceted; includes 9 different types of
queries such as informational and transactional; and encompasses
7 different categorizations. Owing to its specially designed high
diversity, the size of the benchmark, and its real-world nature, GEObench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Generative
Engines and serves as a standard testbed for assessing them for
various purposes in this and future works. We provide more details
about GEO-bench in Appendix B.2.

Benchmark : GEO-bench

Since there is currently no publicly available dataset containing
Generative Engine related queries, we curate GEO-bench, a benchmark consisting of 10K queries from multiple sources, repurposed
for generative engines, along with synthetically generated queries.
The benchmark includes queries from nine different sources, each
further categorized based on their target domain, difficulty, query
intent, and other dimensions.

3.3

GEO Methods

We evaluate 9 different proposed GEO methods as described in
Section 2.2.2. We compare them with a baseline, which measures
the impression metric of unmodified website sources. We evaluate
methods on the complete GEO-bench test split. Further, to reduce
variance in results, we run our experiments on five different random
seeds and report the average.

Datasets: 1. MS Macro, 2. ORCAS-1, and 3. Natural Questions: [1, 6, 13] These datasets contain real anonymized user queries
from Bing and Google Search Engines. These three collectively
represent the common set of datasets that are used in search engine related research. However, Generative Engines will be posed
with far more difficult and specific queries with the intent of synthesizing answers from multiple sources instead of searching for
them. To this end, we repurpose several other publicly available
datasets: 4. AllSouls: This dataset contains essay questions from
"All Souls College, Oxford University." The queries in this dataset
require Generative Engines to perform appropriate reasoning to
aggregate information from multiple sources. 5. LIMA: [25] contains challenging questions requiring Generative Engines to not
only aggregate information but also perform suitable reasoning
to answer the question (e.g., writing a short poem, python code.).
6. Davinci-Debtate [14] contains debate questions generated for
testing Generative Engines. 7. Perplexity.ai Discover2 : These
queries are sourced from Perplexity.ai’s Discover section, which is

3.4

Evaluation Metrics

We utilize the impression metrics as defined in Section 2.2.1. Specifically, we employ two impression metrics: 1. Position-Adjusted
Word Count, which combines word count and position count.
To analyze the effect of individual components, we also report
scores on the two sub-metrics separately. 2. Subjective Impression, which is a subjective metric encompassing seven different
aspects: 1) relevance of the cited sentence to the user query, 2) influence of the citation, assessing the extent to which the generated
response relies on the citation, 3) uniqueness of the material presented by a citation, 4) subjective position, gauging the prominence
of the positioning of source from the user’s viewpoint, 5) subjective count, measuring the amount of content presented from the

Table 1: Absolute impression metrics of GEO methods on GEO-bench. Performance Measured on Two metrics and their
sub-metrics. Compared to baselines, simple methods like Keyword Stuffing traditionally used in SEO don’t perform well.
However, our proposed methods such as Statistics Addition and Quotation Addition show strong performance improvements
across all metrics. The best methods improve upon baseline by 41% and 28% on Position-Adjusted Word Count and Subjective
Impression respectively. For readability, Subjective Impression scores are normalized with respect to Position-Adjusted Word
Count resulting in similar baseline scores.

citation as perceived by the user, 6) likelihood of the user clicking
the citation, and 7) diversity of the material presented. These submetrics assess diverse aspects that content creators can target to
improve one or more areas effectively. Each sub-metric is evaluated
using GPT-3.5, following a methodology akin to that described in
G-Eval [15]. In G-Eval, a form-based evaluation template is provided to the language model, along with a GE generated response
with citations. The model outputs a score (computed by sampling
multiple times) for each citation. However, since G-Eval scores
are poorly calibrated, we normalize them to have the same mean
and variance as Position-Adjusted Word Count to enable a fair and
meaningful comparison. We provide the exact templates used in
Appendix B.3.
Furthermore, all impression metrics are normalized by multiplying them with a constant factor so that the sum of the impressions
of all citations in a response equals 1. In our analysis, we compare
methods by calculating the relative improvement in impression.
For an initial generated response 𝑟 from sources 𝑆𝑖 ∈ {𝑠 1, . . . , 𝑠𝑚 },
and a modified response 𝑟 ′ , the relative improvement in impression
for each source 𝑠𝑖 is measured as:

𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠𝑖 =

𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 ′ ) − 𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 )
× 100
𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑠𝑖 (𝑟 )

RESULTS

We evaluate various Generative Engine Optimization methods
designed to optimize website content for better visibility in Generative Engine responses, compared against a baseline with no optimization. Our evaluation used GEO-bench, a diverse benchmark
of user queries from multiple domains and settings. Performance
was measured using two metrics: Position-Adjusted Word Count and
Subjective Impression. The former considers word count and citation
position in the GE’s response, while the latter computes multiple
subjective factors, giving an overall impression score.
Table 1 details the absolute impression metrics of different methods on multiple metrics. The results reveal that our GEO methods
consistently outperform the baseline across all metrics on GEObench. This shows the robustness of these methods to varying
queries, yielding significant improvements despite query diversity. Specifically, our top-performing methods, Cite Sources, Quotation Addition, and Statistics Addition, achieved a relative improvement of 30-40% on the Position-Adjusted Word Count metric and
15-30% on the Subjective Impression metric. These methods, involving adding relevant statistics (Statistics Addition), incorporating
credible quotes (Quotation Addition), and including citations from
reliable sources (Cite Sources) in the website content, require minimal changes but significantly improve visibility in GE responses,
enhancing both the credibility and richness of the content.
Interestingly, stylistic changes such as improving fluency and
readability of the source text (Fluency Optimization and Easy-toUnderstand) also resulted in a significant visibility boost of 15-30%.
This suggests that Generative Engines value not only content but
also information presentation.

The modified response 𝑟 ′ is produced by applying the GEO method
being evaluated to one of the sources 𝑠𝑖 . The source 𝑠𝑖 selected
for optimization is chosen randomly but remains constant for a

Further, given generative models are often designed to follow
instructions, one would expect a more persuasive and authoritative
tone in website content to boost visibility. However, we find no
significant improvement, demonstrating that Generative Engines
are already somewhat robust to such changes. This highlights the
need for website owners to focus on improving content presentation
and credibility.
Finally, we evaluate keyword stuffing, i.e., adding more relevant
keywords to website content. While widely used for Search Engine
Optimization, we find such methods offer little to no improvement
on generative engine’s responses. This underscores the need for
website owners to rethink optimization strategies for generative
engines, as techniques effective in search engines may not translate
to success in this new paradigm.

Figure 4: Relative Improvement on using combination of
GEO strategies. Using Fluency Optimization and Statistics
Addition in conjunction results in maximum performance.
The rightmost column shows using Fluency Optimization
with other strategies is most beneficial.

In Section 4, we presented the improvements achieved by GEO
across the entirety of the GEO-bench benchmark. However, in
real-world SEO scenarios, domain-specific optimizations are often
applied. With this in mind, and considering that we provide categories for every query in GEO-bench, we delve deeper into the
performance of various GEO methods across these categories.
Table 3 provides a detailed breakdown of the categories where
our GEO methods have proven to be most effective. A careful analysis of these results reveals several intriguing observations. For instance, Authoritative significantly improves performance in debatestyle questions and queries related to the “historical” domain. This
aligns with our intuition, as a more persuasive form of writing is
likely to hold more value in debates.
Similarly, the addition of citations through Cite Sources is particularly beneficial for factual questions, likely because citations
provide a source of verification for the facts presented, thereby enhancing the credibility of the response. The effectiveness of different
GEO methods varies across domains. For example, as shown in row
5 of Table 3, domains such as ‘Law & Government’ and question
types like ‘Opinion’ benefit significantly from the addition of relevant statistics in the website content, as implemented by Statistics
Addition. This suggests that data-driven evidence can enhance the
visibility of a website in particular contexts. The method Quotation
Addition is most effective in the ‘People & Society,’ ‘Explanation,’
and ‘History’ domains. This could be because these domains often

involve personal narratives or historical events, where direct quotes
can add authenticity and depth to the content. Overall, our analysis suggests that website owners should strive towards making
domain-specific targeted adjustments to their websites for higher
visibility.

5.2

Optimization of Multiple Websites

In the evolving landscape of Generative Engines, GEO methods are
expected to become widely adopted, leading to a scenario where
all source contents are optimized using GEO. To understand the
implications, we conducted an evaluation of GEO methods by optimizing all source contents simultaneously, with results presented
in Table 2. A key observation is the differential impact of GEO
on websites based on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP)
ranking. Notably, lower-ranked websites, which typically struggle
for visibility, benefit significantly more from GEO. This is because
traditional search engines rely on multiple factors, such as the number of backlinks and domain presence, which are challenging for
small creators to achieve. However, since Generative Engines utilize

generative models conditioned on website content, factors such
as backlink building should not disadvantage small creators. This
is evident from the relative improvements in visibility shown in
Table 2. For example, the Cite Sources method led to a substantial
115.1% increase in visibility for websites ranked fifth in SERP, while
on average, the visibility of the top-ranked website decreased by
30.3%.
This finding highlights GEO’s potential as a tool to democratize the digital space. Many lower-ranked websites are created by
small content creators or independent businesses, who traditionally
struggle to compete with larger corporations in top search engine
results. The advent of Generative Engines might initially seem disadvantageous to these smaller entities. However, the application
of GEO methods presents an opportunity for these content creators to significantly improve their visibility in Generative Engine
responses. By enhancing their content with GEO, they can reach
a wider audience, leveling the playing field and allowing them to
compete more effectively with larger corporations.

in conjunction with other methods (Average: 31.4%), despite it being
relatively less effective when used alone (8% lower than Quotation
Addition). The findings underscore the importance of studying GEO
methods in combination, as they are likely to be used by content
creators in the real world.

We present a qualitative analysis of GEO methods in Table 4, containing representative examples where GEO methods boost source
visibility with minimal changes. Each method optimizes a source
through suitable text additions and deletions. In the first example,
we see that simply adding the source of a statement can significantly
boost visibility in the final answer, requiring minimal effort from
the content creator. The second example demonstrates that adding
relevant statistics wherever possible ensures increased source visibility in the final Generative Engine response. Finally, the third
row suggests that merely emphasizing parts of the text and using a
persuasive text style can also lead to improvements in visibility.

Combination of GEO Strategies

While individual GEO strategies show significant improvements
across various domains, in practice, website owners are expected
to employ multiple strategies in conjunction. To study the performance improvements achieved by combining GEO strategies, we
consider all pairs of combinations of the top 4 performing GEO
methods, namely Cite Sources, Fluency Optimization, Statistics
Addition, and Quotation Addition. Figure 4 displays the heatmap
of relative improvement in the Position-Adjusted Word Count visibility metric achieved by combining different GEO strategies. The
analysis demonstrates that the combination of Generative Engine Optimization methods can enhance performance, with the
best combination (Fluency Optimization and Statistics Addition)
outperforming any single GEO strategy by more than 5.5%4 . Furthermore, Cite Sources significantly boosts performance when used

in Table 5. Similar to our generative engine, Quotation Addition
performs best in Position-Adjusted Word Count with a 22% improvement over the baseline. Methods that performed well in our
generative engine such as Cite Sources, Statistics Addition show
improvements of up to 9% and 37% on the two metrics. Our observations, such as the ineffectiveness of traditional SEO methods like
Keyword Stuffing, are further highlighted, as it performs 10% worse
than the baseline. The results are significant for three reasons: 1)
they underscore the importance of developing different Generative Engine Optimization methods to benefit content creators, 2)
they highlight the generalizability of our proposed GEO methods
on different generative engines, 3) they demonstrate that content
creators can use our easy-to-implement proposed GEO methods

to optimize their content under generative engines. We define impression metrics for generative engines and propose and release
GEO-bench: a benchmark encompassing diverse user queries from
multiple domains and settings, along with relevant sources needed
to answer those queries. We propose several ways to optimize content for generative engines and demonstrate that these methods can
boost source visibility by up to 40% in generative engine responses.
Among other findings, we show that including citations, quotations
from relevant sources, and statistics can significantly boost source
visibility. Further, we discover a dependence of GEO methods’ effectiveness on the query domain and the potential of combining
multiple GEO strategies in conjunction. We show promising results
on a commercially deployed generative engine with millions of
active users, showcasing the real-world impact of our work. In summary, our work is the first to formalize the important and timely
GEO paradigm, releasing algorithms and infrastructure (benchmarks, datasets, and metrics) to facilitate rapid progress in generative engines by the community. This serves as a first step towards
understanding the impact of generative engines on the digital space
and the role of GEO in this new paradigm of search engines.

RELATED WORK

Evidence-based Answer Generation: Previous works have used
several techniques for answer generation backed by sources. Nakano
et al. [19] trained GPT-3 to navigate web environments to generate
source-backed answers. Similarly, other methods [17, 23, 24] fetch
sources via search engines for answer generation. Our work unifies
these approaches and provides a common benchmark for improving
these systems in the future. In a recent working draft, Kumar and
Lakkaraju [11] showed that strategic text sequences can manipulate
LLM recommendations to enhance product visibility in generative
engines. While their approach focuses on increasing product visibility through adversarial text, our method introduces non-adversarial
strategies to optimize any website content for improved visibility
in generative engine search results.

9

While we rigorously test our proposed methods on two generative
engines, including a publicly available one, methods may need to
adapt over time as GEs evolve, mirroring the evolution of SEO.
Additionally, despite our efforts to ensure the queries in our GEObench closely resemble real-world queries, the nature of queries
can change over time, necessitating continuous updates. Further,
owing to the black-box nature of search engine algorithms, we
didn’t evaluate how GEO methods affect search rankings. However,
we note that changes made by GEO methods are targeted changes
in textual content, bearing some resemblance with SEO methods,
while not affecting other metadata such as domain name, backlinks,
etc, and thus, they are less likely to affect search engine rankings.
Further, as larger context lengths in language models become economical, it is expected that future generative models will be able to
ingest more sources, thus reducing the impact of search rankings.
Lastly, while every query in our proposed GEO-bench is tagged and
manually inspected, there may be discrepancies due to subjective
interpretations or errors in labeling.

Retrieval-Augmented Language Models: Several recent works
have tackled the issues of limited memory of language models
by fetching relevant sources from a knowledge base to complete a
task [3, 9, 18]. However, Generative Engine needs to generate an
answer and provide attributions throughout the answer. Further,
Generative Engine is not limited to a single text modality regarding
both input and output. Additionally, the framework of Generative
Engine is not limited to fetching relevant sources but instead comprises multiple tasks such as query reformulation, source selection,
and making decisions on how and when to perform them.

10
Search Engine Optimization: In nearly the past 25 years, extensive
research has optimized web content for search engines [2, 12, 22].
These methods fall into On-Page SEO, improving content and user
experience, and Off-Page SEO, boosting website authority through
link building. In contrast, GEO deals with a more complex environment involving multi-modality, conversational settings. Since
GEO is optimized against a generative model not limited to simple
keyword matching, traditional SEO strategies will not apply to
Generative Engine settings, highlighting the need for GEO.

Write an accurate and concise answer for the given user question,
using _only_ the provided summarized web search results.
The answer should be correct, high-quality, and written by
an expert using an unbiased and journalistic tone. The user
's language of choice such as English, Francais, Espamol,
Deutsch, or should be used. The answer should be
informative, interesting, and engaging. The answer's logic
and reasoning should be rigorous and defensible. Every
sentence in the answer should be _immediately followed_ by
an in-line citation to the search result(s). The cited
search result(s) should fully support _all_ the information
in the sentence. Search results need to be cited using [
index]. When citing several search results, use [1][2][3]
format rather than [1, 2, 3]. You can use multiple search
results to respond comprehensively while avoiding
irrelevant search results.

CONVERSATIONAL GENERATIVE ENGINE
24

In Section 2.1, we discussed a single-turn Generative Enginethat
outputs a single response given the user query. However, one of the
strengths of upcoming Generative Engines will be their ability to
engage in an active back-and-forth conversation with the user. The
conversation allows users to provide clarifications to their queries
or Generative Engine response and ask follow-ups. Specifically,
in equation 1, instead of the input being a single query 𝑞𝑢 , it is
modeled as a conversation history 𝐻 = (𝑞𝑢𝑡 , 𝑟 𝑡 ) pairs. The response
𝑟 𝑡 +1 is then defined as:
𝐺𝐸 := 𝑓𝐿𝐸 (𝐻, 𝑃𝑈 ) → 𝑟 𝑡 +1

• Difficulty Level: The complexity of the query, ranging from
simple to complex.
• Nature of Query: The type of information sought by the query,
such as factual, opinion, or comparison.
• Genre: The category or domain of the query, such as arts and
entertainment, finance, or science.
• Specific Topics: The specific subject matter of the query, such
as physics, economics, or computer science.
• Sensitivity: Whether the query involves sensitive topics or not.
• User Intent: The purpose behind the user’s query, such as research, purchase, or entertainment.
• Answer Type: The format of the answer that the query is seeking, such as fact, opinion, or list.

where 𝑡 is the turn number.
Further, to engage the user in a conversation, a separate LLM,
𝐿 𝑓 𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 or 𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝 , may generate suggested follow-up queries based
on 𝐻 , 𝑃𝑈 , and 𝑟 𝑡 +1 . The suggested follow-up queries are typically
designed to maximize the likelihood of user engagement. This
not only benefits Generative Engine providers by increasing user
interaction but also benefits website owners by enhancing their
visibility. Furthermore, these follow-up queries can help users by
getting more detailed information.

Evaluation Metrics

We use 7 different subjective impression metrics, whose prompts
are presented in our our public repository: https://github.com/GEOoptim/GEO.

Benchmark

GEO-bench contains queries from nine datasets. Representative
queries from each of the datasets are shown in Figure 2. Further, we
tag each of the queries based on a pool of 7 different categories. For
tagging, we use the GPT-4 model and manually confirm high recall
and precision in tagging. However, owing to such an automated
system, the tags can be noisy and should not be considered carefully.
Details about each of these queries are presented here:

GEO Methods

We propose 9 different Generative Engine Optimization methods
to optimize website content for generative engines. We evaluate
these methods on the complete GEO-bench test split. Further, to

We also evaluate our proposed Generative Engine Optimization
methods on real-world deployed Generative Engine: Perplexity.ai.
Since perplexity.ai does not allow the user to specify source URLs,
we instead provide source text as file uploads to perplexity.ai while
ensuring all answers are generated only using the file sources provided. We evaluate all our methods on a subset of 200 samples of
our test set. Results using Perplexity.ai are shown in Table 7.
